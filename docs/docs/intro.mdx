# Getting Started

- Http-pro is lightweight http client built on top of the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## Features

- First-class typescript support.(Better than default typescript support for Fetch API). 
- Simple syntax(for example, `hp.get(url)` to send get request).
- timeout.
- throwing Error when http status code is not between 200 and 299.(also supports custom error handling logic.)
- create a Instance with default options.
- Lifecycle methods.


## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install http-pro
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add http-pro
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Simple example

```ts

import hp from 'http-pro';

type ResponseData = {
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
  id: number;
  userId: number;
};

const res = await hp.get<ResponseData>('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
console.log(res.data); 
// userId: 1, id: 1, title: "delectus aut autem", completed: false

```


## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
