- `http-pro` provides support for **node.js(v.18)** out of the box. but if you are working with **node.js(v.16)** you need to install one more additional package.


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install http-pro @http-pro/isomorphic 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add http-pro @http-pro/isomorphic 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example

1. node-v16

:::note
As you can see `@http-pro/isomorphic` has a same syntax as `http-pro`, so there won't be any new learning curve if you want to use it in node.

2. node-v18

- At this moment there is no online IDE supports version 18, so if you want to play around with node-18, i have created simple [stater-pack](https://github.com/pranshushah/http-pro/tree/main/node-example) with docker.
