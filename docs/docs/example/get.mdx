## 1. JSON data

- By default when you fetch json data from server, it will be parsed and you will get a javascript object in data property of [HpResponse](../API/HpResponse) object.

<Json />
<br />
<br />

:::note
Here, `res` is just a javascript [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object, so you can also parse data as shown below.

<JsonFetch />

## 2. Text data

- if you are fetching text data then you just need to set `text` as [responseType](../API/HttpOptions#responsetype) and the data property of [HpResponse](../API/HpResponse) will have `text` data.

<Text />
<br />
<br />
