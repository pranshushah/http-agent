## 1. &nbsp JSON data

<Json />

- getting json data is very straight forward. you just have to add url and you will get `json` as javascript object in `res.data` property.

- Here, `res` is just a javascript [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object, so you can also get data as shown below.

<JsonFetch />
