## 1. &nbsp JSON data

<Json />

- getting json data is very straight forward. you just have to add url and you will get `json` as javascript object in `res.data` property.

:::note
Here, `res` is just a javascript [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object, so you can also get data as shown below.

<JsonFetch />

## 2. &nbsp Text data

- getting text data is also very easy with `http-pro`. you just need to set `text` as [responseType](../Types/HttpOptions#responsetype) and in data property of [HpResponse](../Types/HpResponse) object will have `text` data.

<Text />
