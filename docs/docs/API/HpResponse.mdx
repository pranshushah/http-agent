<HpResponse /> <br />{' '}

- whenever you fetch a request using http-pro
  you will get a response which will have following properties.

1. all the properties of javascript [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object.
2. `data` : response data sent by the server.<br/><br/>
   :::note
   By default http-pro assumes that it will get json data from server but if you want change this behaviour, add a desired value in [responseType](HttpOptions#responsetype) property of HttpOptions.
   :::

```ts
export interface HpResponse<ResponseData extends any> extends Response {
  data: ResponseData;
}
```
