- fetch based HTTP client for the browser, node.js, and bun.js.

## WHY http-pro?

1. similar syntax to Axios.
2. Better Typescript support than default fetch API.
3. Works well with URL, Header, URLSearchParams, and Request Object.
4. Instance and extending instances with defaults.
5. interceptor function.
6. validate your response with zod and yup.

## Why Http pro over axios?

- axios uses XMLHttpRequests in browser. so it can't leverage all the new features that javascript provides with fetch-api. for example, axios does not support the Header, Request Objects.
- axios does not does not support service workers and Cache API out of the box.
